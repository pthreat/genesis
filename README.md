# The Genesis Project

Genesis is a tool aimed to gather domain names by generating random / user defined IP addresses. You can think of it as a "web crawler" but it's only aim is to fetch href attributes from web sites in order to populate a crawl_pool table, which can be used afterwards for performing true crawling over the fetched domain names.

## Getting started

Edit your config.h file to your preferences, create a MySQL Database that matches your parameters in config.h
